# Secure Software Implementation for Artemis Financial

## Client and Software Requirements  
Artemis Financial, a financial consulting company, sought to modernize its operations while securing client data on its public web interface. The company needed a file verification step for secure data transmission using a checksum. My task was to integrate secure communication mechanisms into their existing software application.

## Addressing Software Security Vulnerabilities  
I effectively identified security gaps, including predictable hashing and the absence of protective measures against precomputed attacks. I implemented:  

- **SSL/TLS communication** for safe data transmission  
- **SHA-256 hashing** for data integrity  
- **Dynamically generated salt** to ensure unique hash values  

Secure coding is critical because it prevents unauthorized access, data breaches, and financial losses. Strong software security not only safeguards sensitive information but also strengthens user trust and regulatory compliance, ultimately supporting the company's long-term stability.

## Challenges and Security Enhancements  
One of the assessment's most challenging yet rewarding aspects was refactoring the existing code to comply with security best practices. Key improvements included:  

- Implementing **SSL/TLS communication**  
- Checking data with **SHA-256**  
- Ensuring safe hashing practices  

These enhancements provided multiple layers of protection against common threats.

In the future, to assess vulnerabilities, I would use automated tools like dependency-checkers, penetration testing frameworks, and security scanners to identify weaknesses and select appropriate mitigation techniques.

## Ensuring Functionality and Security  
After refactoring the code, I conducted **rigorous functional and security testing** to confirm that no new vulnerabilities were introduced. I tested the application for **secure data transmission** and verified its ability to prevent unauthorized access.

## Useful Tools and Future Applications  
Throughout the project, I used:  

- **Secure coding principles**  
- **Cryptographic best practices**  
- **Security tools** such as SSL certificates and checksum verification  

These practices will be beneficial in future projects where secure software development is required.

## Showcasing to Employers  
This project demonstrates my ability to:  

- Identify **security vulnerabilities**  
- Apply **cryptographic techniques**  
- Ensure **secure communications** in a financial application  

Future employers can see my expertise in implementing **SHA-256 hashing, SSL/TLS communication, and security testing**, highlighting my ability to develop secure, production-quality software.
